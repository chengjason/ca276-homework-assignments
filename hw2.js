/*
 * Please follow the instructions carefully.
 * 
 * When a problem says "send 'foo' to the console that means you would write
 * 
 * 	console.log('foo');
 * 
 * I may also say "send the variable x to the console" in which case you'd write
 * 
 * 	console.log(x)
 * 
 * Note: If you have multiple variables x, y, z you can send all of them to the console like so
 * 
 * 	console.log(x, y, z)
